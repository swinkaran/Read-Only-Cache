Dependency Injection
=====================
DI enables loose ouplong between classes and the dependency they require. DI helps us removing hard-coded object consttruntion from the requesting class, instead allowing the class to request abstrations, often injected into constructor. Implementations of the abstraction are provided to the requesting class by an inversion of control(IoC) containter.
